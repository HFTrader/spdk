Upcoming release
----------------

This release includes a general API cleanup, including renaming all declarations
in public headers to include a `spdk` prefix to prevent namespace clashes with
user code.

- NVMe
  - The `nvme_attach()` API was reworked into a new probe/attach model, which
  moves device detection into the NVMe library.  The new API also allows
  parallel initialization of NVMe controllers, providing a major reduction in
  startup time when using multiple controllers.
  - I/O queue allocation was changed to be explicit in the API.  Each function
  that generates I/O requests now takes a queue pair (`spdk_nvme_qpair *`)
  argument, and I/O queues may be allocated using
  `spdk_nvme_ctrlr_alloc_io_qpair()`.  This allows more flexible assignment of
  queue pairs than the previous model, which only allowed a single queue
  per thread and limited the total number of I/O queues to the lowest number
  supported on any attached controller.
  - Added support for the Write Zeroes command.
  - `examples/nvme/perf` can now report I/O command latency from the
   the controller's viewpoint using the Intel vendor-specific read/write latency
   log page.
  - Added namespace reservation command support, which can be used to coordinate
  sharing of a namespace between multiple hosts.
  - Added hardware SGL support, which enables use of scattered buffers that
   don't conform to the PRP list alignment and length requirements on supported
   NVMe controllers.
- IOAT
  - The DMA block fill feature is now exposed via the `ioat_submit_fill()`
  function.  This is functionally similar to `memset()`, except the memory is
  filled with an 8-byte repeating pattern instead of a single byte like memset.
- PCI
  - Added support for using DPDK for PCI device mapping in addition to the
  existing libpciaccess option.
  - The PCI library API was made more generic to abstract away differences
  between the underlying PCI access implementations.

v1.2.0: IOAT user-space driver
------------------------------

This release adds a user-space driver with support for the Intel I/O Acceleration Technology (I/OAT, also known as "Crystal Beach") DMA offload engine.

- IOAT
  - New user-space driver supporting DMA memory copy offload
  - Example programs `ioat/perf` and `ioat/verify`
  - Kernel-mode DMA engine test driver `kperf` for performance comparison
- NVMe
  - Per-I/O flags for Force Unit Access (FUA) and Limited Retry
  - Public API for retrieving log pages
  - Reservation register/acquire/release/report command support
  - Scattered payload support - an alternate API to provide I/O buffers via a sequence of callbacks
  - Declarations and `nvme/identify` support for Intel SSD DC P3700 series vendor-specific log pages and features
- Updated to support DPDK 2.2.0


v1.0.0: NVMe user-space driver
------------------------------

This is the initial open source release of the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK).

Features:
- NVMe user-space driver
- NVMe example programs
  - `examples/nvme/perf` tests performance (IOPS) using the NVMe user-space driver
  - `examples/nvme/identify` displays NVMe controller information in a human-readable format
- Linux and FreeBSD support
